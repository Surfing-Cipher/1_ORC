Iv.

IT I8 THEREFORE ORDERED that all records and files pertaining to the arrest(s)
granted herein be expunged. Related arrests (same or similar charge, date, or arresting agency)
not specifically listed herein are excluded from this expunction order. However, records of such
unexpunged arrests, which would not have been generated except for the expunged arrest, shall
be expunged.

‘The phrase “all records and files pertaining to the arrest” includes records and files that were
generated by respondents during this expunction proceeding, including the copies of the Petition
and of this order, which are served on each respondent. However, the phrase “all records and
files pertaining to the arrest” does not include records and files that were generated during the
investigation of the crime for which petitioner was arrested, but before the arrest took place, and
that do not indicate that the arrest ever took place.

‘The phrase “all records and files pertaining to the arrest” does not include records relating to the
suspension or revocation of a driver’s license, permit, or privilege to operate a motor vehicle
except as provided in Section 524.015 and Section 724.048 of the Texas Transportation Code.

Vv.

Records and files pertaining to the arrest shall be expunged by turning them in to the Clerk of
this Court, in a sealed envelope.

Videotapes and audiotapes shall be expunged by erasing them.

Records that pertain both to this arrest and to other arrests that are not included in this order, and
that would have been generated even if the expunged arrest had not been made shall be
obliterated (covered with tape, liquid paper, or other opaque substance) only insofar as they
pertain to this arrest. A photocopy of such records, partially obliterated, shall be forwarded to
the District Clerk as specified in the paragraph above.

Each respondent shall attach a certificate to the sealed envelope, certifying that these are all the
expunged records; and the Department of Public Safety shall also certify that it has requested the
FBI and all other central depositories to retum all records and files subject to the order of
expunction.

If retuming records expunged by this order is impracticable, records pertaining to this arrest may
be expunged by the record-keeping agency obliterating or destroying the records as they apply to
this arrest. The agency shall then send a certificate to the District Clerk’s Office certifying that
the records have been destroyed.

VI.
‘The clerk shall certify when the order is final and shall mail certified copies of it:
